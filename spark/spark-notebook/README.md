[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/andypetrella/spark-notebook.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/andypetrella/spark-notebook)

*Originally forked from the amazing [scala-notebook](https://github.com/Bridgewater/scala-notebook), almost entirely refactored for Massive Dataset Analysis using [Apache Spark](http://spark.apache.org).*

The tool allows performing [reproducible analysis](http://simplystatistics.org/2014/06/06/the-real-reason-reproducible-research-is-important/) with Scala, Apache Spark and more.

This is achieved through an interactive web-based editor that can combine Scala code, SQL queries, Markup or even JavaScript in a collaborative manner.

The Spark is available out of the box, and is simply accessed by the variable `sparkContext`.

### Quick Start

Want to try out Spark Notebook? Do these steps.

* Go to [spark-notebook.io](http://spark-notebook.io/).
* Download one of the builds (master is the latest, but unstable).
* Extract the file somewhere convenient.
* Open a terminal/command window.
* Change to the root directory of the expanded distribution.
* Execute the command `bin/spark-notebook` (*NIX) or `bin\spark-notebook` (Windows).
* Open your browser to [localhost:9000](http://localhost:9000).

For details and cofiguration options, see [Launch](details.md#launch).

**Run straight from sources (for geeks)**

Checkout the sources and run:

    $ sbt run
